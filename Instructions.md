### Set List

1. could you create a standard MVP for matching engine? just create one that support LIMIT and match order at the moment

2. now could you set this up to be a simple backend service with placing order endpoint
you can use gin or echo as the framework and to keep it simple just store the orderbook data in json file for now

3. help me tidy up the code, separate it so at least there is a usecase logic separation in another folder and http logic in separate file
